# SubQuery - Accounts project

This is a second part of Spartan program

## Preparation

#### Environment

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are required to compile project and define types.  

- Both SubQuery CLI and generated Project have dependencies and require [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
     

## Build the project

In order to deploy your SubQuery project to our hosted service, it is mandatory to pack your configuration before upload.
Run pack command from root directory of your project will automatically generate a `your-project-name.tgz` file.

```
yarn build
```

## Indexing and Query

#### Run required systems in docker


Under the project directory run following command:

```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up
```
#### Query the project

Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:3000`.

Finally, you should see a GraphQL playground is showing in the explorer and the schemas that ready to query.

For the `subql-starter` project, you can try to query with the following code to get a taste of how it works.

````graphql
{
  query {
    accounts(first:10 orderBy:BALANCE_DESC){
        nodes{
          account
          balance
        }
    }
  }
}
````
